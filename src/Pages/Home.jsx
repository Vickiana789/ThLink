            <p>ThLink is a foundation built on revitalizing education in areas where they are non existent because of a problem specialized by our organization which is the shortage of teachers.
 Why teachers ?   Our competitors believe that the only way  to improve a society is by increasing the amount of buildings in the area or donating money. Although these things are helpful we dcommunity and attempt to change so that it can be reformed  for our terms of the better we educate the students so they can be enlightened and grow their culture themselves. This doesn't only stand to benefit students as we also increase job opportunities  for educators. Our developers created a systematic cycle in which the teacher is offered a fair living in the area where they are resigned to teach  and  provisions if they can complete levels of tedious online classes which have vital educational and cultural knowledge. Help yourself help others the
